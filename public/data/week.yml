  abstract: |
    This talk explores exact solution techniques for nonlinear partial differential equations using Wronskian and Pfaffian structures. I introduce the historical development of soliton theory and outline how bilinear forms and Hirota operators enable constructive solution methods. I present explicit Wronskian and Pfaffian solutions to the variable-coefficient generalized KP equation, including both Wronski-type and Gramm-type Pfaffianizations. I also derive double Wronskian solutions for a (2+1)-dimensional Boussinesq system and show how determinantal identities support these constructions. The results demonstrate how determinantal and Pfaffian frameworks provide a unified and efficient approach for generating multi-soliton solutions in higher dimensional integrable systems.
