  title: "Transitioning to 6G: Emerging Use Cases, Testing Frameworks, and the UAE 6G Innovation Hub"
  status: confirmed  # Optional field, defaults to "confirmed" if not specified

  abstract: |
    The transition from fifth-generation (5G) networks to sixth-generation (6G) communications represents a transformative rise toward intelligent, adaptive, and sustainable connectivity. While 5G achieved remarkable advances in data throughput, latency, and reliability, 6G will extend these capabilities to enable AI-native, energy-efficient, and sensing-integrated networks. This new generation will seamlessly merge the physical and digital realms, empowering real-time digital twins, immersive holographic experiences, autonomous mobility, etc. A major challenge in this transition lies in testing and validation. The integration of distributed architecture that incorporates terrestrial, aerial, and satellite systems demands federated testbeds capable of modeling complex real-world environments. These testbeds are crucial to benchmarking real-network key performance indicators (KPIs), ensuring interoperability, reinforcing security, and accelerating the standardization of 6G systems. This seminar aims to cover those technologies, challenges as well as introduce the UAE 6G Innovation Hub, a pioneering platform for advance 6G experimentation, integrated sensing, and quantum-secure networking. The discussion will explore the 6G roadmap, emerging use cases, and how the UAE's federated testbed model is shaping the nation's leadership in global 6G innovation.

  abstract: |
    Facial image processing and analysis is the task of automatically analyzing face images in order to acquire information about the depicted persons. This includes a person's identity, emotional state, facial gestures, age, and gender. The large number of European projects that involves facial image processing as a part shows its crucial role in a wide range of application domains, such as security, smart environments, human-computer interfaces, and content-based image and video analysis. Considering the advanced security needs of the society and the shift to the paradigm of human-centered computing for natural interfaces, the interest in face processing is expected to continue with increasing pace. In this talk Dr. Ekenel is going to present an overview of computer vision research activities @ Smart Interaction and Machine Intelligence (SiMiT) Lab. The topics will include but not limited to face recognition, facial expression analysis, face anonymization, face generation, and their applications.

  title: "Derivation of Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation for Rogue Waves in a Dusty Plasma"
  status: confirmed  # Optional field, defaults to "confirmed" if not specified\

  abstract: |
    Dusty plasmas are ubiquitous not only in laboratory, space and astrophysical environments but also have potential applications in industry, technology and other areas of modern science. The existence of different kinds of wave modes and their coupling have made it possible to understand the plasma collective oscillations at different scales and the salient features of associated nonlinear waves and instabilities in these plasma environments. Starting from the normalized fluid equations for an unmagnetized dusty plasma containing electrons, ions, and charged dust grains, the nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) has been derived by using multiple-scale perturbation method. Further, the rational solutions of NLSE are discussed to study the existence of different kinds of rogue waves. In this study, we also explore the intricate interplay between the nonthermal enhancement of polarization forces and their impact on the modulational instability (MI) of dust acoustic waves (DAWs), as well as on various types of dust acoustic rogue waves (DARWs). The rational solutions of NLSE bring to light the emergence of DA  rogue waves. This theoretical exploration sheds light on the significant role of nonlinear dynamics in generating various DARWs, offering valuable insights for experimental observations and understanding phenomena in different space environments, such as planetary spokes and cometary tails.

  title: "On Solving an Open Problem in Continuum Mechanics"

    In this talk, I will briefly describe my journey, along with the trials and tribulations, of developing smart materials with wide-ranging real-world applications. In the course of this work, I developed several models, algorithms, and principles, as well as a parallel finite-element software package, and I solved an open problem in continuum mechanics. Interestingly, solving that open problem turned out to be the easiest part of my research. To make the presentation accessible, even to a six-year-old, I will demonstrate several physical experiments (appropriate for audiences aged 18 and over) during the seminar. As Einstein famously said, "If you can't explain it to a six-year-old, you don't understand it yourself." I will do my best to rise to that challenge.

    Dr. M. H. B. M. Shariff is a faculty member in mathematics at Khalifa University in Abu Dhabi, UAE. Although there is nothing exceptional about him, he is the primary or sole author of most of his publications, having independently (effectively wrote the papers by himself) contributed to a broad range of research areas. His work spans the finite element method, numerical algorithms, parallel computing, digital phase-locked loops (in electrical engineering), and continuum mechanics, including biomechanics, electromagnetic fields, and damage mechanics.
