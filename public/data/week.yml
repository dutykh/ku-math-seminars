  abstract: |
    The hydrodynamic and integrable Manakov equation can rise from the coupled nonlinear Schrödinger equation, when the crossing angle of two wave fields correspond to particular values. We report observations of exact Manakov envelope solitons and breathers in a water wave basin. Considering the challenges in building the appropriate experimental set-up to observe the clean evolution of crossing wave envelopes, the data show an excellent agreement with the theory. The experiments shed a new light on rogue wave formation in the ocean, particularly, when two wave systems are at play.

  title: "Agentic AI for Digital Economy: Uncensorability and Turbulence Resistance"
  status: confirmed  # Optional field, defaults to "confirmed" if not specified\
  start: 2025-11-12T14:00:00+04:00

    Privacy primitives like BaseSAP restore unlinkability, but the digital economy can fail when block producers bias or delay inclusion. This talk introduces a neutrality-aware, agentic AI stack that detects censorship risk in post-Merge PBS, adapts execution through relay diversification, inclusion lists, and local-build fallback, and feeds latency and inclusion signals into trading and payments agents. The talk quantifies how such turbulence compresses anonymity sets, distorts prices, and erodes profits, and then demonstrates controls that restore autonomy and performance. The outcome is a deployable framework for censorship-resilient, turbulence-resistant on-chain agentic AI operations. No part of this talk should be interpreted as financial or investment advice.

  title: "Lower Partial Moments for Skew Elliptical Distributions: Theory and Applications in Risk Analysis"
  status: confirmed  # Optional field, defaults to "confirmed" if not specified\
  start: 2025-11-13T15:00:00+04:00
  end: 2025-11-13T16:00:00+04:00
  location: SAN Campus, ADCO Auditorium
  abstract: |
    Robust modeling with skewed distributions is crucial in risk management, as many real-world datasets deviate from symmetry. This study derives explicit representations for lower partial moments (LPMs) of arbitrary powers n≥1for the normal, skew-normal, and skew-t distributions addressing a gap in the literature where closed-form results were lacking. Numerical analyses show that short-term stock price data can often be modeled by these distributions. Portfolio comparisons based on computed LPMs provide quantitative measures of relative risk. The results offer both theoretical contributions through new analytical expressions and practical tools for robust portfolio formation and risk assessment.

  title: "Oxygen Deficiency Drives Drastic Pattern Transition in Algal Bioconvection"
  status: confirmed  # Optional field, defaults to "confirmed" if not specified\
  start: 2025-11-14T11:00:00+04:00
  end: 2025-11-14T12:00:00+04:00
  location: Main Campus, R02013
  abstract: |
    Suspensions of motile microorganisms can spontaneously form large-scale fluid motion, known as bioconvection, characterized by dense downwelling plumes separated by broad upwelling regions. In this study, we investigate bioconvection in shallow suspensions of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii confined within spiral-shaped boundaries, combining detailed experiments with three-dimensional simulations. Under open liquid-air interfaces, cells accumulate near the surface via negative gravitaxis, generating spiral-shaped density patterns that subsequently fragment into lattice-like clusters, leading to plume formation. Space-time analyses demonstrate coherent rotational dynamics, with predominantly inward-directed motion near the spiral core and bidirectional motion further out. Introducing confinement by sealing the upper boundary with an air-impermeable wall triggers dramatic pattern transitions due to oxygen depletion: initially stable arrangements reorganize into new structures with significantly reduced wavelengths. Complementary numerical simulations, based on incompressible Navier-Stokes equations incorporating negative buoyancy and active swimmer stress, successfully replicate initial pattern formation, subsequent instability, fragmentation into plumes, and emergence of strong vortical flows—nearly an order of magnitude faster than individual cell swimming. However, these models do not capture oxygen depletion-driven transitions observed experimentally. Our results highlight that geometric confinement, oxygen availability, and metabolic transitions critically regulate bioconvection dynamics, offering novel strategies for controlling microbial self-organization and fluid transport.

  title: "SPX, VIX and scale-invariant LSV"
  status: confirmed  # Optional field, defaults to "confirmed" if not specified\

  abstract: |
    This talk examines the convergence of physics, data, and mathematics to model the mechanical link between VIX and the S&P 500. Using the Buckingham-Π theorem, we construct dimensionless variables and identify an optimal kernel that relates VIX to a smoothed price index. The estimated kernel follows a power-law shape, and a simple quadratic in the dimensionless index explains most VIX variation, achieving out-of-sample R2 near 88-89%. Residuals exhibit fast mean reversion, enabling a clean separation between structural drivers and market noise. Embedding the kernel in a local-stochastic-volatility framework then allows the generation of plausible market scenarios and the assessment of volatility and barrier products. Overall, the approach shows how dimensional reasoning, grounded in data, yields parsimonious, interpretable, and operationally effective models for risk management.
