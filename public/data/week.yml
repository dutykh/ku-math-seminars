    Privacy primitives like BaseSAP restore unlinkability, but the digital economy can fail when block producers bias or delay inclusion. This talk introduces a neutrality-aware, agentic AI stack that detects censorship risk in post-Merge PBS, adapts execution through relay diversification, inclusion lists, and local-build fallback, and feeds latency and inclusion signals into trading and payments agents. The talk quantifies how such turbulence compresses anonymity sets, distorts prices, and erodes profits, and then demonstrates controls that restore autonomy and performance. The outcome is a deployable framework for censorship-resilient, turbulence-resistant on-chain agentic AI operations. No part of this talk should be interpreted as financial or investment advice.

  title: "Different Models for 3D Space in Molecular Geometry"
  status: confirmed  # Optional field, defaults to "confirmed" if not specified\
  start: 2025-11-18T12:00:00+04:00

    This talk will explore the utilization of two different geometric approaches (homogeneous and conformal models) for computing interatomic distances, and their derivatives, in terms of internal coordinates of molecules. While the traditional Euclidean model has long been employed to represent 3D space in molecular dynamics, the homogeneous coordinate system introduces an extra dimension that allows for a unified algebraic representation of molecular transformations, such as translations and rotations. The conformal model further extends this framework by adding an additional dimension for scale and uniquely enables the orthogonal representation of rotations and translations. We will discuss how these two models may enhance the efficiency of modeling molecular geometry and transformations.

  abstract: |
    The use of tapered beams is ubiquitous in the sensing and actuation elements of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS). Yet the distinct advantages of the tapered beam over the traditional rectangular one are often left unarticulated due to the blind trust in the finite-element models of MEMS devices. In this talk, I will take a fundamental, physics-based approach to the modeling of tapered beams in MEMS that is based on a rigorous perturbation analysis of the traditional Euler-Bernoulli beam. I will demonstrate how perturbation methods combined with symbolic modeling and the tools of computer algebra enable the development of semi-analytical models for tapered-beam MEMS elements. I will pay particular attention to the application of these novel models to piezoelectric MEMS energy harvesters, including the development of lumped-parameter circuit models that can be readily used for fast, highly accurate, electro-mechanical simulations. This talk is based on our recently published monograph: Wajih U. Syed and Ibrahim (Abe) M. Elfadel, 'Tapered Beams in MEMS: A Symbolic Modeling Framework with Applications to Energy Harvesting', Springer, 2024.

    Quantum computers promise to revolutionize the way we process information by harnessing the unfamiliar laws of quantum mechanics. But behind this new technology lies a rich mathematical foundation — from linear algebra and complex numbers to probability and information theory. In this talk, we will explore how mathematics shapes our understanding of quantum bits, quantum logic, and the remarkable power of quantum algorithms. No prior knowledge of quantum physics is required — just curiosity! Through simple examples and visual explanations, we will see how abstract mathematical ideas translate into real technological advances, opening the door to new ways of thinking about computation, science, and the future.

    This talk presents a deep reinforcement learning framework for the capacitated VRP under dual uncertainty in customer demand and time-varying traffic. The method encodes the routing graph with attention-based graph neural networks, models dynamics as a POMDP, enforces feasibility via action masking, and trains policies with PPO. Two hybrid variants combine learning with a k-nearest greedy mask and a Clarke-Wright-guided mask. Across seven scenarios on grid environments with up to 200 customers, the learned policies reduce travel cost versus classical heuristics and greedy baselines, keep inference practical, and generalize beyond training scales.
