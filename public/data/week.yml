    title: "Nonexistence of global weak solutions to semilinear wave equations involving time-dependent structural damping terms"
    status: confirmed  # Optional field, defaults to "confirmed" if not specified

    end: 2025-10-09T16:00:00+04:00
    location: SAN Campus, Zarkuh Bldg, ADCO Auditorium
    abstract: |
      We consider a semilinear wave equation involving a time-dependent structural damping term of the form (1 + t)^{-β}(−∆)^{σ/2}u_t. Our results show the influence of the parameters β and σ on the nonexistence of global weak solutions under suitable assumptions on the given data of the system.

    title: "Turing Test 2.0: The Possibility, Usefulness and Challenges of Imitating a Specific User through Generative AI"
    status: confirmed  # Optional field, defaults to "confirmed" if not specified
    start: 2025-10-07T17:00:00+04:00

      It is already known that Large Language Models (LLMs) can imitate humans well enough to pass the Turing test   but the question remains whether an individual can truly be modeled. In this talk, the focus will be placed on personalization: the extent to which user behavior can be predicted from history and context. Because LLMs are trained on sequential human data, choices, preferences, and even quirks can often be mirrored. It will be shown that positive predictions, such as what is likely to be known, done, or preferred, can be generated, while negative predictions, such as what is unlikely to be understood or chosen, are also possible. Group patterns are captured effectively by LLMs like GPT-4, but their performance decreases significantly when smaller groups or individuals are modeled. This limitation carries important implications, and open challenges will be raised on how statistical guarantees of user-behavior modeling can be specified without measuring countless individuals.

      Monojit Choudhury is a Professor of Natural Language Processing at Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI), Abu Dhabi. Before joining MBZUAI, he was appointed as Principal Scientist at Microsoft Research India and Microsoft Turing. His research has been focused on the intersection of Natural Language Processing, socio-cultural aspects of technology use, and ethics. Work has been carried out by him on multilingual and multicultural aspects of large language models (LLMs), their application in low-resource languages, and approaches to make LLMs more inclusive and safer. AI has also been used by him to study how language patterns interact with socio-cultural norms and values. Prof. Choudhury serves as Associate Editor of Communications of the ACM and IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence. Over 150 peer-reviewed publications and multiple best paper awards have been credited to him. His academic training was received at IIT Kharagpur, where he earned both BTech and PhD degrees.

    title: "Exploring Nonlinear Lattices in the Presence of an On-Site Potential: on the Influence of Nonlinear Coupling in Klein-Gordon Systems"
    status: confirmed  # Optional field, defaults to "confirmed" if not specified
    start: 2025-10-10T10:00:00+04:00
    end: 2025-10-10T11:00:00+04:00

    abstract: |
      The talk will focus on the modulational dynamics of a wave packet propagating in a one-dimensional (1D) hybrid α-Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou / Klein-Gordon (α-FPUT-KG) lattice chain, incorporating quadratic coupling nonlinearity in the presence of an onsite potential. Using Newell's multiple-scales method, we derive a nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) and obtain analytical expressions for the dispersion (P) and nonlinearity (Q) coefficients in terms of the carrier wavenumber k and the system parameters. We then explore the conditions under which focusing and defocusing regimes occur, which in turn determine the types of envelope soliton solutions supported by the system. Particular attention is given to the Peregrine soliton, a solution that can theoretically capture the phenomenon of freak (rogue) waves-extreme, high-amplitude waves that appear and disappear suddenly in an oscillatory medium. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the continuum theory in comparison with the underlying discrete system.

    title: "PDE models for deep neural networks: learning theory, calculus of variations and optimal control"
    status: confirmed  # Optional field, defaults to "confirmed" if not specified
    start: 2025-10-13T14:00:00+04:00

    abstract: |
      We propose a partial differential-integral equation (PDE) framework for deep neural networks (DNNs) and their associated learning problems by taking the continuum limits of both network width and depth. The proposed model captures the complex interactions among hidden nodes, overcoming limitations of traditional discrete and ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based models. We explore the well-posedness of the forward propagation problem, analyze the existence and properties of minimizers for the learning task, and provide a detailed examination of necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of critical points. Controllability and optimality conditions for the learning task with its associated PDE forward problem are established using variational calculus, the Pontryagin Maximum Principle, and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, framing the deep learning process as a PDE-constrained optimization problem. In this context, we prove the existence of viscosity solutions for the latter and we establish optimal feedback controls based on the value functional. This approach facilitates the development of new network architectures and numerical methods that improve upon traditional layer-by-layer gradient descent techniques. The paper provides a mathematical foundation for connecting neural networks, PDE theory, variational analysis, and optimal control. By integrating these fields, we offer a robust framework that enhances deep learning models' stability, efficiency, and interpretability.
