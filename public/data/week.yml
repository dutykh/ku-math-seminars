    title: "From Classical to Optimized Waveform Relaxation: Advances in Circuit Simulation and Beyond"

    abstract: |
      Waveform relaxation (WR) methods solve large systems of ODEs in parallel by decomposing them into smaller subsystems and iteratively coupling their solutions. Classical WR (CWR), based on Jacobi or Gauss-Seidel schemes, often suffers from slow or inconsistent convergence, especially in tightly coupled systems. To address these issues, variants such as Robin WR (RWR) improve convergence significantly through the use of carefully designed transmission conditions. Originally developed for VLSI circuit simulations, WR methods have since been extended to solve time-dependent PDEs as well. In this talk, I will review classical and optimized WR techniques, focusing on both continuous-time and discrete-time analyses in circuit models, and I will highlight some connections to PDEs.

    title: "On the global existence and uniform-in-time bounds for three-component reaction-diffusion systems with mass control and polynomial growth"
    status: confirmed  # Optional field, defaults to "confirmed" if not specified
    start: 2025-10-03T10:00:00+04:00
    end: 2025-10-03T11:00:00+04:00
    location: R01013, Main Campus
    abstract: |
      A class of three-component reaction-diffusion systems subject to mass control and a newly introduced structural assumption, referred to as linear intermediate weighted sum condition, will be presented. Under these hypotheses, the global existence of classical solutions in arbitrary spatial dimensions and wide class of boundary conditions, even when the nonlinearities exhibit arbitrary polynomial growth is established. We also present that, under slightly stronger assumptions and mixed boundary conditions, solutions admit uniform-in-time bounds. Our approach relies on the extension of L^p-energy polynomial functionals (a Lyapunov functional), together with the regularizing effect for parabolic equations. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of our framework by analyzing three-species sub-skew-symmetric Lotka-Volterra systems with higher-order interactions, and a reversible chemical reaction.
