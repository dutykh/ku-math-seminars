    title: Singular Limits in Dispersive Partial Differential Equations
    start: 2025-08-20T12:00:00+04:00
    end: 2025-08-20T13:00:00+04:00
    location: Main Campus, Building A, Room 301

      We study the behavior of **dispersive PDEs** in the singular limit where certain parameters become small. 
      
      Using matched asymptotic expansions and rigorous mathematical analysis, we establish convergence results 
      for the nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation with rapidly varying coefficients. The main challenges include:
      
      - Handling oscillatory integrals in multiple scales
      - Proving uniform bounds on the solution family
      - Establishing convergence to the effective equation
      
      This work has applications to water wave theory and quantum mechanics.

      Islamic finance presents unique challenges for risk management due to Sharia compliance requirements.
      We present a comprehensive framework using advanced stochastic calculus techniques.
      
      Key contributions include novel approaches to:
      - Sukuk pricing under uncertainty
      - Profit-sharing investment accounts modeling
      - Operational risk in Islamic banking

    title: Machine Learning Applications in Computational Fluid Dynamics
    start: 2025-08-23T16:00:00+04:00
    end: 2025-08-23T17:00:00+04:00
    location: Main Campus, Building A, Room 105
    abstract: |
      We explore the integration of deep learning techniques with traditional CFD solvers
      to accelerate simulation of complex fluid flows.
      
      **Research objectives:**
      - Develop physics-informed neural networks for flow prediction
      - Reduce computational cost while maintaining accuracy
      - Apply to real-world engineering problems in UAE industries
      
      This is preliminary work from my PhD thesis under supervision of Prof. Dutykh.
