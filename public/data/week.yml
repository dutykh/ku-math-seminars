      This presentation focuses on heterogeneity in porous media and how it can be characterized using image processing and machine learning. In the first part, we explore the variation of pore sizes, shapes, and spatial arrangements in computed tomography (CT) images. Here, textural descriptors combined with supervised and unsupervised classification provide an automated way to differentiate reservoir rocks and link their structural features to physical properties. The second part examines micro-CT data across multiple length scales, showing how texture-based approaches can be used to upscale rock properties from the pore scale to the core scale. In the final part, we present a quantitative description of carbonate rock heterogeneity using multifractal theory, offering a rigorous framework to capture pore complexity and its implications for flow and transport processes.

      Dr. Mohamed Soufiane Jouini received his Ph.D. in Signal and Image Processing from Bordeaux University, a Master of Science in Signal and Image Processing from the National Polytechnic Institute of Toulouse, and a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering from the same institution. Before transitioning to academia, Dr. Jouini gained substantial experience in research and development within industry, including roles at TOTAL E&P Research Centre in Pau, France, and SAGEM SÉCURITÉ (now IDEMIA) in Paris, France. In early 2010, he joined the Petroleum Institute (now part of Khalifa University) as a Research and Teaching Associate, where he focused on image-based digital rock physics projects. In 2014, he was appointed Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics at Khalifa University and has served as Associate Professor since 2020. Dr. Jouini's research focuses on image processing, digital rock physics, fractals, and machine learning. He applies advanced imaging and computational methods to model and predict physical properties in applications such as oil reservoir characterization, CO₂ sequestration, and water desalination. His work has earned notable recognition, including: The Oil & Gas Year Award (2016) in the "Partnership of the Year" category for a digital rock physics project on core sample analysis and the R&D Bright Finding & Integration Pen award from ADNOC R&D (2014) for best integration of research into industry.

    title: "Scenario tree generation for multistage stochastic programming"
    status: confirmed  # Optional field, defaults to "confirmed" if not specified

      Multistage stochastic programming relies on the construction of scenario trees to represent uncertainty across decision stages. In this work, we develop a data-driven framework for scenario tree generation. The framework consists of two steps: scenario extraction from historical data and subsequent scenario reduction. The quality of the reduced scenario trees is assessed using a metric for probability space distance, for example, the Wasserstein distance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we apply it to a multistage portfolio selection problem, highlighting its ability to balance computational tractability with representational fidelity.
