    title: "Partial Symmetries and Hidden Patterns: Symmetric Inverse Monoids and Quasi-Crystals"

      Symmetric inverse monoids occupy a central position in semigroup theory, serving as canonical examples of inverse semigroups and providing a rich framework for understanding partial symmetries. Unlike full symmetries, which apply everywhere, partial symmetries describe transformations that work only on part of a system. These are surprisingly powerful tools for understanding complex structures. This talk explores their foundational role in the algebraic structure of semigroups, emphasizing their combinatorial elegance and rank properties. 
      
      A particularly intriguing aspect of symmetric inverse monoids is their emerging connection to the mathematical modeling of quasi-crystals. These aperiodic structures, which defy classical crystallographic symmetries, find a natural algebraic counterpart in the partial bijections encoded by inverse monoids. We will examine how the combinatorics of these monoids—especially their rank stratification and idempotent structure—mirror the local symmetries and tiling rules observed in quasi-crystalline formations.
      
      Whether you're curious about how abstract math finds its way into physics, or simply intrigued by the beauty of hidden patterns, this talk offers a glimpse into how algebraic thinking helps us make sense of the unexpected.

    title: "Multiperiod interval-based stochastic dominance with application to dynamic portfolios"
    status: postponed  # Optional field, defaults to "confirmed" if not specified
    start: 2025-09-26T10:00:00+04:00

    abstract: |
      We consider a multi-stage generalization of the interval-based stochastic dominance (ISD) principles introduced by Liu, Chen and Consigli (2021). The ISD criterion was motivated specifically in a financial context to allow for contiguous integer SD orders on different portions of a portfolio return distribution against a benchmark distribution. A continuous spanning of SD conditions between first-, second-, and third-order stochastic dominance was introduced in that context, relying on a reference point. Here, by extending the partial order to random data processes, we apply ISD conditions to a multi-period portfolio selection problem and verify the modeling and computational implications of such an extension. Several theoretical and methodological issues arise in this case that motivate this contribution. The problem is formulated in scenario form as a multistage stochastic recourse program, and we study two possible generalizations of ISD principles in which we either enforce ISD constraints on each stage, independently from the scenario tree process evolution, or we do so conditionally along the scenario tree. We present a comprehensive set of computational results to show that, depending on the benchmark investment policy and the adopted ISD formulation, stochastic dominance conditions of first- or second-order can be enforced dynamically over a range of possible values of the reference point, and their solution carries a specific rationale. The computational constraints induced by the multistage ISD formulation are also emphasized and discussed in detail.

      Dr. Giorgio Consigli is Associate Chair of Graduate studies and Associate Professor of Mathematics at Khalifa University (since 2021) and Fellow of the UK Institute of Mathematics and its Applications. Previously, he held faculty positions at the University of Bergamo and worked in quantitative development at UniCredit Investment Bank. He earned his PhD at the University of Essex (1995) and held a PostDoc position at the University of Cambridge. His research focuses on stochastic optimization, quantitative finance, and computational methods in risk and asset-liability management, with long-standing collaborations across Europe, the US, and Asia. Giorgio is Springer author as contributor and with three volumes edited to the Int. Series of Operations Research and Management Science.

      He has served on the Scientific Committee of the Stochastic Programming Society (COSP), co-founded the Italian Stochastic Programming section, and is a Board Member of the EURO WG on Commodity and Financial Modelling. He has organized major international conferences and delivered keynote talks worldwide. Dr. Consigli is Area Editor for OR Spectrum and the IMA Journal of Management Mathematics, Associate Editor of several journals, and guest editor of multiple special issues. He has a relevant record of research grants and advanced training grants in the area of computational methods in finance and applied mathematics both at national and international levels.
