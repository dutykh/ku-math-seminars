      We propose a partial differential-integral equation (PDE) framework for deep neural networks (DNNs) and their associated learning problems by taking the continuum limits of both network width and depth. The proposed model captures the complex interactions among hidden nodes, overcoming limitations of traditional discrete and ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based models. We explore the well-posedness of the forward propagation problem, analyze the existence and properties of minimizers for the learning task, and provide a detailed examination of necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of critical points. Controllability and optimality conditions for the learning task with its associated PDE forward problem are established using variational calculus, the Pontryagin Maximum Principle, and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, framing the deep learning process as a PDE-constrained optimization problem. In this context, we prove the existence of viscosity solutions for the latter and we establish optimal feedback controls based on the value functional. This approach facilitates the development of new network architectures and numerical methods that improve upon traditional layer-by-layer gradient descent techniques. The paper provides a mathematical foundation for connecting neural networks, PDE theory, variational analysis, and optimal control. By integrating these fields, we offer a robust framework that enhances deep learning models' stability, efficiency, and interpretability.

    title: "Vegetation patterns in arid ecosystems: a self-organized response to water scarcity"
    status: confirmed  # Optional field, defaults to "confirmed" if not specified
    start: 2025-10-14T15:00:00+04:00

    abstract: |
      Arid ecosystems are vulnerable to desertification and land degradation due to climate change, overgrazing and deforestation. As aridity increases, the spatial homogeneity of vegetation cover is lost and it self-organizes into heterogeneous patterns [1,2], which is a precursor to a catastrophic shift to bare soil [3]. Several studies suggest that environmental inhomogeneities in time or space could be crucial to understand these phenomena [4,5]. Using a unified mathematical model and incorporating environmental inhomogeneities in space, we show how two branches of vegetation patterns create a hysteresis loop as the mortality level changes. In an increasing mortality scenario, one observes an equilibrium branch of high vegetation biomass that forms self-organized hexagonal-like patterns. However, when the mortality trend is reversed, one observes a branch with low biomass and no evident patterning, where vegetation spots form clusters instead. This behavior is supported by remote sensing and field observations and can be linked to climate change trends in arid ecosystems.

    abstract: |
      Quantum droplets are self-bound states that arise in ultracold atomic gases through a delicate balance between attractive interactions and quantum fluctuations. They are modeled by nonlinear Schrödinger equations and provide a rich setting where concepts from quantum physics intersect with nonlinear dynamics and dynamical systems. In this talk, I will discuss discrete quantum droplets (in systems with, e.g., a linear lattice potential), which may exist within an exponentially small “pinning region”. I will also outline how their stability can be established. Throughout, I will emphasize physical intuition, illustrative examples, and how asymptotic analysis complements numerical computations.

    title: "Backtestability of Risk Measures"

    abstract: |
      Backtesting risk measures, such as Value at Risk (VaR), is a consolidated practice in financial risk management and banking regulation since at least 3 decades ago. Yet, a formal definition of “backtest of a risk measure” was missing until very recently. Questions such as whether a given risk measure is backtestable or not, were ill-posed, and spurred confusion and controversy in the financial risk literature. The case of Expected Shortfall (ES) was devoted special attention (and heated academic debates) since its adoption as a capital adequacy standard in Basel 3. Backtestability – whatever it exactly means – is a non-negotiable property for a risk regulation standard. We try to put some order, providing a first definition of backtest of a risk measure. We discuss the relationship between backtestability and elicitability. We then introduce the important subclass of “sharp backtests” which allow to measure the discrepancy between the predicted (ex-ante) risk and the actual (ex-post, realized) risk, thereby providing corrective feedback to risk models. Finally, we illustrate the mechanism of a “ridge backtest”, by which some non-backtestable risk measures still admit a prudential form of approximated backtest. We did not forget to tell you if the ES is backtestable or not: for that you will have to wait until the end of the presentation.
