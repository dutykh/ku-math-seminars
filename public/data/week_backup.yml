    title: Singular Limits in Dispersive Partial Differential Equations
    status: confirmed  # Optional field, defaults to "confirmed" if not specified
    start: 2025-08-20T12:00:00+04:00
    end: 2025-08-20T13:00:00+04:00
    location: Main Campus, Building A, Room 301
    abstract: |
      We study the behavior of **dispersive PDEs** in the singular limit where certain parameters become small. 
      
      Using matched asymptotic expansions and rigorous mathematical analysis, we establish convergence results 
      for the nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation with rapidly varying coefficients. The main challenges include:
      
      - Handling oscillatory integrals in multiple scales
      - Proving uniform bounds on the solution family
      - Establishing convergence to the effective equation
      
      This work has applications to water wave theory and quantum mechanics.
